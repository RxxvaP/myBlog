        <p class="para">My hobby is gaming. I really like to game a lot so I can check out new games that have been released to see if they are really cool or something I would like to play a lot. There are different types of games out there like spy, food, making money, in real life games, and a lot of other cool types out there. My favorite game is a game on Roblox called 'Welcome to Bloxburg'. I really like this game a lot because it's just like what we do in real life but a game version. Make money, own new houses, have a job, shopping.
